## Codes

### A simple model

We start with a simple model. The model has six states which is mentioned in paper "Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning: Integrating Temporal Abstraction and Intrinsic Motivation".

Our new codes are in folder "random_idea". We test methods such as drawing subgoal randomly, drawing the farthest state.

### Other codes

We copy and modify some existing experiments, such as Flappy Bird (in folder "DeepLearningFlappyBird-master") and Data-Efficient HRL (in folder "efficient-hrl").

## Reports

Proposal is in folder "proposal".

Progress report is in folder "progress".

## References

Some references are in folder "refs", "stochastic NN" and "other_refs (maybe not so related)".

## Game

The game MontezumasRevenge is in folder "game". It supplies to be played by humans.
