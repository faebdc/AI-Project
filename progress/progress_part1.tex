    It is widely accepted that h-DQN (Hierarchy Deep Q-Learning) is developed to tackle the efficiency problem of $\epsilon -$greedy Q-Learning when the reward is sparce. However, after we study the problem setting and reimplement the method proposed in (ref 1), we find another big advantage of h-DQN over traditional Q-Learning and DQN (Deep Q-Learning) (ref 2) is that
